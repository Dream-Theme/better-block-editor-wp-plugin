This plugin adds responsiveness to Row, Grid, and other blocks. It also introduces animation on scroll, responsive visibility, and more!

== Description ==
Forget about page builders! We believe that Better Block Editor is the only plugin you need to build beautiful, responsive websites using WordPress's native Block Editor.

This simple plugin adds responsiveness to Row, Stack, Grid, Columns, Navigation, and other select blocks.

Additionally, we've included Responsive Visibility and Animation on Scroll for all blocks.

We have also further enhanced the Navigation and Button blocks with hover color settings!

Responsiveness breakpoints are fully customizable, including support for custom points. Different features can be selectively enabled or disabled through an intuitive settings interface.

What's even more important, Better Block Editor comes with an impressive library of pre-made websites, patterns, and other content to kick-start your project.

The design system is unified across all content, making it easy to mix, match, and customize to suit your chosen theme!

This plugin was created with love, and we hope the community finds it useful.
Your feedback is always appreciated!
